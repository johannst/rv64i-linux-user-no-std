# Shipped core library is build with `imac` extensions, since we disable `mac`
# we have to rebuild `core`.
# Unstable features are only enabled with a nightly toolchain:
# > cargo +nightly build
#
# Validate the resulting binary by checking the instructions & encodings:
# > llvm-objdump -C -d <bin>
